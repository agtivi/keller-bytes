                Hey there, I figured what better a place to share my testimony than on here.
                <br/><br/>
                My belief towards God has always wavered throughout my life, for 16 years of it I didn't even believe in Him at all. At first I did, then I didn't, and now I do again.
                <br/><br/>
                The reason I do again is gonna sound like I was just hysteric, but truly I know what I experienced and it honestly wasn't anything big. I was just laying in bed one
                night and heard a very loud and scary exhale into my ear. I thought I was being haunted, and so my previous beliefs of just no spiritual activity being real were laid
                to rest. I immediately turned to God for protection because He's the all powerful, and in this turning towards Him I saw so much more. 
                <br/><br/>
                The secret to true happiness, the ability to love honestly, and the genuine fulfillment of life. For one week of my life, I've been able to toss away all worries, 
                love everyone with a true heart, trust it all to Him, and truly be happy. 
                <br/><br/>
                I've lost that fulfillment now... He's blessed me with so many experiences in life, but since then I've failed time and time again 
                to be able to truly toss aside my flesh. I worry for a job, I worry for a future, I worry for my wellbeing, for no reason I've lost my ability to completely trust in 
                Him. I pray I get it back some day, and I know that He will give it to me eventually. Just when I am ready. 
                <br/><br/>
                For now, I'm trying my best to learn and program projects to show myself off to people in hopes that I'll get a job. Truly I've failed. Once I gain the heart to do 
                this, not for other people's attention and recognition of my abilities, but for my own genuine love of programming and software development, 
                then I will regain my spot alongside Him in happiness and fulfillment. For now though, I struggle. If you've read this through the whole way, thank you for reading and 
                taking the time to learn a little bit about God's presence in my life. May He touch your life in some manner to bless you, or show you a blessing He's done for
                you. And no matter who you are, just know you are truly loved, if not by anyone else in this world... then most certainly by
