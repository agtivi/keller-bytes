Hey there, my name's Anthony and this is my personal website project. It utilizes the Next.js framework along with a few other dependencies such as gsap or React Three Fiber so far.

To run the website on your own computer, all you have to do is duplicate the repository on your own device using Git and make sure you have any required installations for Next.js installed
such as nodejs and npm. 

Make sure you get into a console and if you have all the dependencies needed then just run 

```npm install```

then

```npm run dev```

Enjoy!
